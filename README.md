## PROJECT PAUSED

This project has been temporarily paused to complete my Kotlin language course and stay up-to-date with the latest Angular (now 18) version. I'm also finalizing the "Wheel of Innovations" project, which inspired this study. This ongoing project involves randomly selecting new technologies to learn as quarterly or semi-annual challenges, ensuring I remain proficient in various languages and frameworks.
